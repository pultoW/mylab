Our research is centered around the exciting domain of network intelligence and optimization.

We are specifically focused on the following research:

- **Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)**
- Mobile Edge Computing focuses on extending computation and storage capabilities to the edge of the network, closer to end-users and devices. By enabling processing and analysis of data at the network edge, MEC reduces latency and enhances real-time applications. This technology empowers various applications such as augmented reality, IoT, and content delivery by optimizing resource utilization and providing a more responsive user experience. 
- **Distributed Learning and Inference**
- Distributed Learning and Inference involve training machine learning models across multiple devices or nodes, often geographically dispersed. This approach minimizes the need to centralize data, addressing privacy concerns, and reducing communication overhead. Collaborative learning and federated learning are key concepts, allowing devices to learn from each other's data without sharing it explicitly. Distributed inference refers to making predictions using decentralized models, enabling efficient and scalable AI applications across networks.
- **Network Optimization and Economics**
- Network Optimization and Economics explore the balance between resource allocation, performance enhancement, and economic considerations in network design and operation. This area encompasses techniques to optimize network parameters such as routing, bandwidth allocation, and load balancing. Additionally, it delves into understanding the economic aspects of network services, pricing models, and resource trading, ensuring efficient utilization of network resources while considering market dynamics.
